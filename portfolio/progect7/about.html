                    <span class="arr">&nbsp;</span>
                    <div class="about-text">
                        <p>Pro.Financial’s team is composed of some of the brightest and most ambitious traders and analysts in the world. The firm was
                            originally a trading club established in 2007 by a few day traders who worked in some of the biggest names in the banking
                            industry.</p>
                        <p>2008 and 2009, were not a great period for the financial market, and nothing was really stable at the time, the shock of current events
                            caused many different brokers to rethink their strategies. The club which would later become Pro.Financial started off as a
                            hobby to earn extra money and to explore new strategies and ideas by three incredibly talented analysts and interns. Every few
                            days a different analyst or intern would host the get together at his house and the traders would bring in their computers sit
                            for hours doing trades and trying to figure out new ways to forecast the market.</p>
                        <div class="text-inside">
                            <p>Five months later the club came up with an indicator called “The Ox indicator”
                                named after the “year of the Ox”, the indicator was based on calendarian events.
                                The indicator had instantaneous success and the group brought in 40,000$
                                together in less than two weeks. Word spread very quickly amongst co-workers of
                                some of these analysts and a few weeks later the club gained an additional four
                                members, one of them, a veteran of the financial market who was extremely
                                intrigued by the “The Ox indicator” but felt like there was place to improve the
                                indicator. Surely enough they created an addition to the indicator that would
                                support “The Ox indicator” called “The Ox stabilizer” or “TOS”.</p>

                            <p>It would only take a
                                year for the clients to
                                reach 75% in profits,
                                and for the firm to triple
                                its size.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>
                        <p>In 2010, after creating an additional 5 unique indicators the members of the club decided to open up a small firm called
                            Pro.Financial. The firm would only have close circle friends and family invested. It would only take a year for the clients to
                            reach 75% in profits, and for the firm to triple its size. In October of 2011, the firm chained the indicators into a highly
                            advanced algorithmic system which would consist of 26 different indicators and would then open its door to the public.</p>

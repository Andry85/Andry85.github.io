                            <p>It is no secret that in the past two years managed portfolios have Automated trading, black-box trading, or simply algo-trading
                                been occupying many of the common Forex trader’s mind as the
                                alternative has been gaining popularity rapidly due to the
                                simplicity and time saving capabilities it provides. Speaking to a
                                vast amount of potential clients we have noticed that many of
                                them do not possess time to trade nor want to learn how to trade
                                as the process of trading with an account manager seems like a
                                frustrating chore or too complex.</p>
                            <p>Offering a potential client a managed portfolio that is tailored to
                                his needs seems like a more responsible choice rather than
                                teaching a clueless individual how to trade. Managed accounts
                                and Mutual Funds are a more accepted alternative in other
                                financial firms by investors as they naturally believe a professional
                                trader can gain them a higher profit. The idea is simple, when you
                                are injured you go to a doctor for treatment due to his
                                specialization in the field, so when seeking profit in the market
                                you will look for a specialist in trading.</p>

                            <p>The biggest secret to success in the financial market has been let out
                                of the bag in the past few years. Algorithmic trading has flipped the
                                market upside down, with one third of all trades in the U.S and Europe
                                operated under an automated or partially automated system.
                                In the past only large companies and wealthy investors had the
                                privilege of using Algorithms to trade, it was rare for the average
                                trader to gain such access. Today there are different algorithmic
                                systems available to traders with different qualities and prices. There
                                are simple algorithms and sophisticated types that are encrypted.</p>

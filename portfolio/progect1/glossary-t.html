                                            <b>TECHNICAL ANALYSIS important term</b>
                                            <p>Technical analysis is the study of price action as reflected on charts of a market, asset class, or underlying instrument and the study of various indicators of derived classes (underlying) in order to anticipate the evolution, and subsequent direction of markets and the specific asset which you are trading.</p>
                                            <p>This graphical extrapolation applies to all types of markets: indexes, equities, fixed income, commodities, options, futures, etc. It is not limited to equity markets; the same tools and methods that are mastered can then be applied to any (other) type of underlying asset when its price is determined by the meeting of supply and demand.</p>
                                            <p>The main tool of the technical analyst is the graph that allows the visualization and analysis of an underlying asset. Regardless of the fundamentals, regardless of whatever may be occurring in the market now or in the future, the graphical chart reflects exactly what is happening at any specific moment in time.</p>
                                            <p>Hence, successful trading ultimately boils down to your ability to ‘see’ – trading is a visual acuity, your ability to recognize repetitive chart patterns and to act, to execute instantly upon recognition of a trend reversal pattern, recognition of support, resistance, retraces, pull backs, etc.</p>
                                            <p>The objective, the goal and purpose of trading, and therefore technical analysis is the ability to correctly forecast or recognize trends, and if possible, the signs of trend reversals. It involves identifying market conditions that give statistically identical, repetitive results; at least to a statistical probability of a minimum of 70%. 85% is preferable and attainable.</p>
                                            <p>Technical analysis does not purport to be an exact science. It is closer to a human science as its object of study is directly focused on understanding the psychology of the market and how human nature does have waves, bio rhythms, repetitive patterns and behavior, for example, the Fibonacci retracement tool is based on absolute mathematical patterns in nature and thus, human nature.</p>
                                            <ul class="list-inner">

                                                    <h4>Principles</h4>
                                                    <p>There are three fundamental axioms that governs and is the foundation of technical analysis:</p>
                                                    <ol type="1">
                                                        <li>
                                                            <strong>The market takes everything into account.</strong>
                                                            <p>This axiom is certainly the most important of all 3 because it justifies the fact that technical analysis is only interested in current, at the moment, market data and not to fundamentals such as economic statistics and business results. Indeed, if, at any moment, the price of an underlying asset immediately incorporates all available information on the markets, then there is no need to focus on the fundamentals as it is almost impossible to enjoy an announcement effect.</p>
                                                        </li>
                                                        <li>
                                                            <strong>Courses follow trends.</strong>
                                                            <p>It is the observation of historical price charts which gives the technical analyst the market trends. The study of a stock chart identifies phases, increases and decreases in phases over periods ranging from minutes to years. </p>
                                                            <p>To explain this phenomenon is not just due to chance, technical analysis is based on the psychological analysis of crowds. Market, as a crowd, can be taken either in a dynamic optimism (or euphoria), or in a dynamic pessimism (or despair), and in a hesitation phase. This is reflected in a graph by periods of rising, falling or sideways or stagnant prices; times we will identify respectively as uptrend, as downtrend, and as range. </p>

                                                            <strong>History repeats.</strong>
                                                            <p>There is a popular, almost famous disclaimer on all financial corporate sites, including ours – that past performance isn’t indicative of the present or future – words to that effect. Here’s the truth – the future is determined by the past market and the same "mistakes" always repeat (formation of speculative bubbles and crashes). </p>
                                                        </li>
                                                    </ol>
                                                </li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>Again, this idea stems from the psychological analysis of a crowd. Sociologists who are interested in crowds claim that they have identified specific behaviors having no link with a simple sum of individual behaviors. A crowd is driven by certain principles that manage to transcend the psychology of the individual component. All will have more influence on the part that each party will have in the least because of the phenomenon of imitation existing within any group.</p>
                                            <p>The decision of an individual in a crowd is based on the idea that it is the decision that will persuade the other individuals in the crowd and not the normal perception of reality. This applies to markets that crash and speculative bubbles which are recurring; these are the best examples of the existence of the principle of imitation, which prohibits any lesson from the past to the crowd.</p>
                                            <p>Laws or principals or repetitive patterns are to be noticed by technical analysts and then to attempt to take advantage of the recurring phenomena; techies know that there are no absolutes and that they usually employ several confirming scenarios before a decision, rather than take action on one technical factor.</p>
                                            <p>As a trader, you should consider technical analysis as a practical approach to trading than as a perfect science and know that in order to execute winning trades, you will always have losing trades. No one trades at 100% no matter how experienced and skilled they may be.</p>
                                            <p>The strength of technical analysis which can lead many to consider it as a science (social and not hard) is that it is produced and continually used by traders who have a daily and pragmatic view of the markets and continually behave in predictable patterns, proving the efficacy of this approach to the markets. A famous quotes with respect to technical analysis is that of George Lanes: "The trend is your friend" – this sentence sums up the advantages but also controversial technical analysis.</p>

                                            <p>If you look at an example of a currency pair such as the EUR/USD you will see three-letter designations for each currency correspondent to the country, although some countries use the same currency from a different country, for example, Turks and Caicos Islands, and Timor-Leste use the US Dollar (USD) as opposed to their own currency.</p>
                                            <p>Regardless, each currency has a designated currency code according to ISO 4217. In addition, Commodities such as Gold, Silver, Platinum, etc., also have designated three-letter codes, e.g. XAU for Gold, XPD for Palladium, XPT and XAG for Platinum and Silver.</p>
                                            <p>What is ISO 4217, you may ask? <cite>According to SVN, the Swiss Association for Standardization,</cite>“ISO 4217 is the International Standard for currency codes. The most recent edition is ISO 4217:2008. The purpose of ISO 4217:2008 is to establish internationally recognized codes for the representation of currencies. Currencies can be represented in the code in two ways: a three-letter alphabetic code and a three-digit numeric code.”</p>

                                            <p>Currency is traded in pairs or crosses – one is your ‘base’ currency, the first currency quoted in the currency cross or pair, and the other is the ‘quote’ currency - buying one currency while simultaneously selling the other. For example, the Euro is normally paired against multiple currencies such as the U.S. Dollar (or EUR/USD), the British Pound (sometimes referred to as the British Cable - EUR/GBP), or the Australian Dollar (EUR/ AUD).</p>
                                            <p>The currency pair shows how much of the quote currency is needed to purchase one unit of the base currency. The ‘bid’ (buy price) represents how much of the quote currency is needed for you to get one unit of the base currency. Conversely, when you sell the currency pair, you sell the base currency and receive the quote currency. The ‘ask’ (sell price) for the currency pair is what you would receive in the quote currency for selling one unit of base currency. <a href="open_trading.html" title="">Start Trading Today!</a></p>

                                            <p>The commodity currencies originate from countries which have large quantities of natural resources or commodities. These natural resources usually represent the majority of these countries' exports, and subsequently the strength of these economies are highly dependent on the market prices of these commodities.</p>
                                            <p>Not all countries rich in natural resources have currencies which are commonly traded. As a result, trading will usually involve only these three countries which are not only rich in commodities, but also have free floating or liquid currency. These are Australia, New Zealand, and Canada represented by the Australian Dollar, The New Zealand Dollar, and the Canadian Dollar! <a href="open_trading.html" title="">Invest Now!</a></p>

                                            <b>WHY TRADE THE FOREX</b>
                                            <p>You can consider other investment opportunities but the Foreign Exchange, known as FOREX, presents the individual investor such as yourself (or any investor) with one of the greatest possibilities of profit (ROI) in the shortest time frame.</p>
                                            <p>And it does not make a difference what the state of the economy is - <strong>the Foreign Currency Market is a virtual bull market</strong> – constantly on the move, as one currency exchange rate goes down, the other paired currency rate goes up!</p>
                                            <p>The most appealing, alluring aspect of forex trading is the opportunity to experience capital gains in a short period of time. Trading on Liberty Banc’s #1 Binary Options Currency Exchange Platform does not require the time consuming educational requirements historically needed for more complex trading platforms such as metatrader.</p>
                                            <p>Some of our traders are trading within minutes after opening an account – immediate profits do occur and can happen for you in a matter of minutes to a few hours.

                                            <p>The FOREX is an emerging, developing, and rapidly evolving industry with a 'new jargon’ being created to describe new found processes and trading methodologies. As an account holder with Liberty Banc, you have access to excellent education and training at little to no cost depending on account types and features (<a href="#" title="">see account types</a>).</p>
                                            <p>In the past, trading on desk top, mobile trading and web based trading platforms such as metatrader 4 (mt4) required an expenditure of time to learn and execute competently and successfully. Short term trading, scalping, swing trading and day trading were for experienced, educated and thoroughly trained professionals, not for the beginner, part-timer or faint of heart.</p>
                                            <p>Before the explosion of the Binary Options Evolution, it used to take months and years of training to understand platform processes, setting up charts and chart patterns, fundamental and technical analysis, and the 100’s of different leading and lagging indicators, and more importantly, to trade successfully.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Until Now!</strong> Liberty Banc’s industry leading, #1 Binary Options Trading Platform has removed the complexity and simplified the entire forex trading process so that you do not have to study for years just to begin trading.</p>

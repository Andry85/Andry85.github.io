                                            <p>Chartist analysis is an investment method based on the study of price and volume of the various listed securities. It is also called graphical analysis. This method is especially used by traders who apply in the very short term to take positions on the market. The chartist analysis can however be used in the medium and long term.</p>
                                            <p>For this, it is based on historical price and identifies areas of reversing trend. These areas are called psychological support and resistance. At their approach, based on the historical price, investors tend to buy near support and sell near resistance. This is the mimicry of investors who gives strength to the reversal. But beware, this method is not foolproof, support and resistance are made to be broken. </p>
                                            <p>During their break, there is often bullish or bearish acceleration in either a support or resistance. Subsequently a study of figures formed by the stock can be performed. These figures, such as the bull W, triangle, and many others are all indications to determine the evolution of the share price.</p>
                                            <p>Mathematics plays an important role in the chartist analysis, we can calculate the potential increase or decrease. However, the chartist analysis is a study of investor behavior, their psychology. This method is in contrast to the fundamental analysis that it is based on the study of business in these accounts.</p>

                                                        <h4>History</h4>
                                                        <p>If you look at an example of a currency pair such as the EUR/USD you will see three-letter designations for each currency correspondent to the country, although some countries use the same currency from a different country, for example, Turks and Caicos Islands, Timor-Leste use the US Dollar (USD) as opposed to their own currency.</p>
                                                        <p>Regardless, each currency has a designated currency code according to ISO 4217. In addition, Commodities such as Gold, Silver, Platinum, etc., also have designated three-letter codes, e.g. XAU for Gold, XPD for Palladium, XPT and XAG for Platinum and Silver. </p>
                                                        <p>What is ISO 4217, you may ask? According to SVN, the Swiss Association for Standardization,“ISO 4217 is the International Standard for currency codes. The most recent edition is ISO 4217:2008. The purpose of ISO 4217:2008 is to establish internationally recognized codes for the representation of currencies. Currencies can be represented in the code in two ways: a three-letter alphabetic code and a three-digit numeric code.”</p>

                                                        <p>Currency is traded in pairs or crosses – one is your ‘base’ currency, the first currency quoted in the currency cross or pair, and the other is the ‘quote’ currency - buying one currency while simultaneously selling the other. For example, the Euro is normally paired against multiple currencies such as the U.S. Dollar (or EUR/USD), the British Pound (sometimes referred to as the British Cable - EUR/GBP), or the Australian Dollar (EUR/ AUD).</p>
                                                        <p>The currency pair shows how much of the quote currency is needed to purchase one unit of the base currency. The ‘bid’ (buy price) represents how much of the quote currency is needed for you to get one unit of the base currency. Conversely, when you sell the currency pair, you sell the base currency and receive the quote currency. The ‘ask’ (sell price) for the currency pair is what you would receive in the quote currency for selling one unit of base currency.<br><a href="open_trading.html">Start Trading Today!</a></p>

                                                        <p>The commodity currencies originate from countries which have large quantities of natural resources or commodities. These natural resources usually represent the majority of these countries' exports, and subsequently the strength of these economies are highly dependent on the market prices of these commodities.</p>
                                                        <p>Not all countries rich in natural resources have currencies which are commonly traded. As a result, trading will usually involve only these three countries which are not only rich in commodities, but also have free floating or liquid currency. These are Australia, New Zealand, and Canada represented by the Australian Dollar, The New Zealand Dollar, and the Canadian Dollar!</p>

                            <p>Trading binary options, forex, and all trading in financial markets and financial instruments involves significant risk. Liberty Banc strongly advises that you read
                                our Terms & Conditions. Although the risk when trading binary options is fixed for each individual trade, the trades are live and it is possible that you will lose
                                an initial investment, particularly if you choose to place your entire investment in a single live trade. It is highly recommended that you choose proper money and
                                risk management strategies which may limit the total of consecutive trades, or total outstanding investment, or may limit loss.</p>

                        <dt>The primary reasons and advantages of working with<br> managed accounts at Pro Financial:</dt>
                        <dd>According to our experience and research a large portion of clients solely responded to the idea of managed
                            accounts. The option was the difference between a new client and a refusal.</dd>
                        <dd>From our experience when a trader was doing well through a social trading platform he was keen to adding
                            money to the account.</dd>
                        <dd>The social trading platforms do not want the client to succeed, and so when there is a trader who gains popularity
                            and high profits, he is either deleted from the system by the social trading platform provider or he is restricted
                            by the hosting broker from other clients to follow. It is also important to note that it is common that the brokers
                            use plugins that cause execution delays for the client which results with the client losing his money.</dd>
                        <dd>Pro Financial holds strong ties with many well-known and transparent brokers and liquidity providers such as
                            Lmax which is recognized as one of the largest and most trustworthy brokers in the field today. Choosing to work
                            with such brokers means the client will be directly connected to the largest banks making the trades legit and the
                            execution time of the trades unmatched in the market.</dd>
                        <dd>Although Pro Financial is at the beginning of its legacy, it has already accumulated 450 clients with a substantial
                            amount of money, and a few prospects which are on the way to join us.</dd>
                        <dd>Pro Financial currently has a licensed trading specialist with an impressive track record which we are confident
                            will prove himself with our client’s portfolios.</dd>
                        <dd>Our vision is that in the near future we will have a floor of skilled traders which will compete to bring the clients
                            high gains.</dd>
                        <dd>Automating the majority of the trading process is one of our main objectives to facilitate the management of the
                            portfolio.</dd>
                    </dl>
                    <p class="info">One of the most unique points we offer at Pro Financial is the ability to intake American clients as we will be
                        cooperating with a broker that holds such a permit. Working with American clients is a huge advantage in the
                        market as many IB’s seek such brokers. Opening up the doors to the American market is a tremendous boost<br>
                        for any broker due to the popularity of such investments.

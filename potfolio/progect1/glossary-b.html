                                            <p>Currency is traded in pairs or crosses – one is your ‘base’ currency, the first currency quoted in the currency cross or pair, and the other is the ‘quote’ currency - buying one currency while simultaneously selling the other. For example, the Euro is normally paired against multiple currencies such as the U.S. Dollar (or EUR/USD), the British Pound (sometimes referred to as the British Cable - EUR/GBP), or the Australian Dollar (EUR/ AUD).</p>
                                            <p>The currency pair shows how much of the quote currency is needed to purchase one unit of the base currency. The ‘bid’ (buy price) represents how much of the quote currency is needed for you to get one unit of the base currency. Conversely, when you sell the currency pair, you sell the base currency and receive the quote currency. The ‘ask’ (sell price) for the currency pair is what you would receive in the quote currency for selling one unit of base currency.</p>

                                                <strong>What Are Binary Options?</strong>
                                                <p>Binary Options are limited risk options contracts. Often called “All or Nothing”, Binary options are usually categorized as either a cash-or-nothing binary option or an asset-or-nothing binary option. </p>
                                                <p>Essentially, a binary option is a call / put, yes / no, up or down proposition meaning that there are only two possible outcomes; either you are correct or incorrect as to the exact direction the price of the underlying asset will move – up or down (virtually impossible, but a binary option can expire at the exact same price – 3rd outcome)</p>
                                                <p>To put it in a simpler term – Binary Options is <strong>directional trading.</strong> In trading, there’s an expression – “The Trend is Your Friend” – you either make this your golden rule, or you lose all your money. Here at Liberty Banc, we’ve been trend and directional trading for many years. Successfully.</p>

                                                <strong>Benefits of Trading on Liberty Banc’s Binary Options Trading Platform</strong>
                                                <p>Trading Binary Options is today’s simplest, most innovative method for trading all the asset classes that normally require extensive education and training, including the complexities of the other trading platforms.</p>
                                                <p>On the flip side are Binary Options. First, all your risks are immediately defined before you begin trading. Second, only you can determine how much to win or lose on each trade. You know exactly how much you will win or lose as opposed to traditional trading where you could possibly lose your entire account if you are not careful.</p>
                                                <p>With binary options, all your trade parameters, all your risk parameters are clearly defined before you execute the trade. Therefore, no need for stop losses, profit limits, no need to even constantly monitor the trade.</p>
                                                <p>At expiration the option will be worthless or the exact return you chose before executing the trade.  Also, since you are not purchasing the underlying instrument (commodity, stock, index, forex) again you have limited, defined risk before you begin.</p>
                                                <p>With Liberty Banc, we make trading binary options easy and simple, as opposed to difficult and complex. </p>

                                                    <strong>Executing a Binary Options Trade with Liberty Banc is a simple and easy 4 step process.</strong>
                                                    <p>First, you choose what asset group and which asset within that group you wish to trade – for example, you might choose commodities, then gold.</p>
                                                    <ul>

                                                            <p>1)	Pick the asset group – stock, commodity, forex, index – and then pick the underlying instrument – EUR/USD, Gold, Google, etc</p>
                                                            <p>Second, you choose the specific time frame for the trade – do you want the trade to expire in 1 minute, 30 minutes? 1 hour (or longer)?</p>
                                                            <p>For example if you think Gold at $1440 will drop below $1440 in the next minute, and you want to risk $100, you choose sell and if you’re correct, you will win approximately $85. If you are incorrect and Gold after 1 minute expired at $1441, then you lost the $100. </p>
                                                            <p>You have an opportunity to execute trades in 1 minute, 5 minutes, 1 hour and longer and normally earn anywhere from 75-90% and even 300% or more on your investment. Quite a lucrative return for such a short time frame. </p>

                                                            <p>4)	Execute the Binary Options trade by picking and clicking the direction – either up / call or down / put.</p>
